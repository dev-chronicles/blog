### Welcome to Dev Chronicles!

Dev Chronicles is a blog for learning and exploration. It's not intended to provide a standard or doctrine, but rather 
to share experiences, learnings, and insights that might be useful for other engineers in their own projects. This
can be a place to try out new technologies, learn new software design patterns, and grow together.

### About Me

Hi! I'm Cory. I've worked as a software engineer for almost 15 years, and have been in cybersecurity for the last
half of those. Two of my professional passions include creating software solutions that enable other engineers and
sharing learning experiences with my peers. This blog provides an outlet for me to practice both of those passions,
both by creating and sharing opensource projects and by sharing my learning and research into new technologies
and processes.
